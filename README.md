sphrs2d
===========================

Playing around with SPH simulation in Rust. All 2d for now.

Implements solvers using
* WCSPH
* DFSPH (wip!)

To find resources about fluid simulation in general check out [my gist on CFD](https://gist.github.com/Wumpf/b3e953984de8b0efdf2c65e827a1ccc3) where I continously gather links and short descriptions on various concepts.
